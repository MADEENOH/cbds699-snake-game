# CBDS 699 - Snake Game (In-Class Assignment 1)

This repository contains a simple Snake Game developed as part of **In-Class Assignment 1** for the CBDS 699 course at Harrisburg University, taught by Professor Ziyuan Huang.

## 💡 Assignment Context
The assignment required students to use **Generative AI tools** (e.g., ChatGPT) to ideate, code, and customize a playable game. I chose to build a classic **Snake Game** using Python with the help of ChatGPT prompts and Python logic support.

## 🎮 Game Features
- Snake movement with arrow keys
- Score increases when food is eaten
- Game ends if the snake hits itself or the wall
- Real-time keyboard input and screen updates using Python’s `curses` module

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run the Game
1. Open Terminal on your Mac.
2. Navigate to the folder with the script:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/game
